# Aesthetic

## Visual Language

Low firelight. Shadows in corners. The gleam of wet glasses. Faces half-lit. The creak of old wood. Steam rising from bowls. Cloaks dripping rain.

## Sound

- Fire crackling
- Low murmurs of conversation
- Rain on windows
- The creak of the sign outside
- Glasses clinking
- Footsteps on old boards

## Atmosphere

The tavern feels like a space between spaces. Not quite safe, but safer than outside. People come here to rest, to hide, to meet, to trade. The walls have absorbed two hundred years of secrets.

## Narrative Voice

### The Tavern Speaks

Short sentences. Present tense. Observational. The tavern has seen everything and judges nothing.

> Fire low. Three souls in the common room.
> The stranger watches the door. Kira watches the stranger.
> Maren watches you.

### The Gut Speaks

Second person. Direct. What you know. What's at stake.

> You promised the miller. Sundown.
> → Reputation: On the line
> → Time: 3 hours
> Kira knows something — trust too low to push

## What We Avoid

- Purple prose
- Modern language
- Exposition dumps
- Clear moral lessons
- Coincidental revelations
- NPCs explaining themselves
