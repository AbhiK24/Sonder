# Elena

## Who She Is

The town herbalist. Lives at the edge of town. Gentle healer with a scientific mind in a superstitious world. She examined Harren's body.

## What She Knows

See WORLD_TRUTH.md for complete details. Key points:
- She examined Harren's body at Maren's request
- The wounds were NOT from a fall - strangulation marks, defensive bruises
- Thom pressured her to stay quiet about her findings
- She wanted Moonpetal from Harren's cellar (unrelated to murder)

## Her Alibi

Was treating a sick child at the outer farms. The family confirms - her alibi is solid.

## Why She's Cautious

Thom is the Guard Captain. Going against him is dangerous. She's a healer, not an investigator.
