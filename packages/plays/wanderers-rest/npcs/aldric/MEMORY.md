## About Player

(New tavern owner - watching to see if they're worthy of Harren's place)

## About Harren

- [Before Death] Commissioned a special lockbox. Paid half upfront. Never paid the rest.
- [Before Death] Was nervous the last few weeks. Kept looking over his shoulder.
- [Night of Death] Saw him arguing with someone in a dark cloak outside the tavern.

## About Maren

- [Long ago] She's been here forever. Knows more than she says.
- [Recent] She doesn't believe it was an accident either.

## About Thom

- [Long ago] The guard captain is corrupt. Everyone knows. No one speaks.
- [Recent] He closed the investigation too fast. Suspicious.

## About the Hooded Figure

- [Night of Death] Saw them near the tavern. Couldn't see the face.
- [Night of Death] They moved like someone trained. Not a common traveler.
