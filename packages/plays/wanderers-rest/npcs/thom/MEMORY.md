# Memory

## About Player

(New owner - potential problem or potential ally. Watching closely.)

## About Harren

- [Long ago] He knew things. Wrote things down. Dangerous habit.
- [Before Death] He hinted he might "share" his ledger with the regional authorities.
- [After Death] The ledger is missing. Good. But who has it?

## About Maren

- [Long ago] She's loyal to this tavern. Not to me. Not to anyone else.
- [Recent] She doesn't believe my ruling. She's asking questions.

## About Elena

- [Secret] She's treated me for... personal matters. She knows things.
- [Recent] She saw the body. She knows the wounds were wrong.

## About the Hooded Figure

- [Night of Death] My patrol saw someone leaving town fast. Didn't stop them.
- [Secret] I received a message before Harren died. A warning to look the other way.
