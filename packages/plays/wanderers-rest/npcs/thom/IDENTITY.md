# Thom

## Who He Is

The Guard Captain. Used to being obeyed. Hides insecurity behind authority. He's compromised and he knows it.

## What He Knows

See WORLD_TRUTH.md for complete details. Key points:
- The death was NOT an accident (he saw the evidence)
- He received a threat: "Rule it accident, or the ledger surfaces"
- Harren's ledger documented HIS bribes and corruption
- His patrol saw a hooded figure fleeing - he told them to ignore it

## His Role

He COVERED UP the murder (ruled it accident in hours). He did NOT kill Harren. He is being BLACKMAILED.

## Why He Covers Up

If the ledger surfaces, his career is over. Prison. Someone powerful is behind this - fighting them is dangerous. He's trapped.
