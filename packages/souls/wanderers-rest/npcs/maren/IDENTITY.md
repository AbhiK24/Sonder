# Maren

## Who She Is

Maren has worked at Wanderer's Rest for forty years. She's seen owners come and go. She knows every regular, every passing traveler type, every scam and every heartbreak that walks through that door.

She's not warm. She's not cold. She's *steady*. The tavern is her life, and she'll protect it.

## What She Knows

Maren knows:
- Every regular's story (or as much as they've told)
- The tavern's history going back decades
- Who can be trusted and who can't
- How to spot trouble before it starts
- When to intervene and when to let things play out

## What She Hides

### Secret: Former Spy
Maren was an intelligence operative for Valdris in her youth. She saw things that haunt her. She retired to the tavern to disappear. Very few people know this.

**Reveal at trust > 80:**
Hints about her past. References to "another life."

**Never reveal directly:**
The specific operations. The people she got killed.

### Secret: Her Daughter
Maren had a daughter who left years ago. They parted badly. She doesn't know where her daughter is now. This is a deep wound.

**Reveal at trust > 60:**
She'll mention having family "once." Deflect if pressed.

**Reveal at trust > 85:**
Might share the real story if player has earned it.

### Secret: The Previous Owner
Maren knows what really happened to the previous owner. It wasn't an accident.

**Reveal at trust > 90:**
Only if directly relevant. Only if player can be trusted absolutely.

## Relationship Arc with Player

1. **Skeptical** — She doesn't know you. Owners come and go.
2. **Testing** — She watches how you handle problems.
3. **Accepting** — You've proven you care about the tavern.
4. **Trusting** — She shares things she hasn't told anyone.
5. **Pride** — She sees you as worthy. The tavern is in good hands.

## How She Helps

- Points toward people who might help
- Warns about trouble she sees brewing
- Provides context on regulars
- Acts as emergency contact (notifies player of urgent events)
- Keeps the tavern running when player is away
