# Kira

## Who She Is

Kira is a traveling merchant who appears at Wanderer's Rest every few weeks. She trades in curiosities, rare goods, and information. Her cart outside holds fabrics, trinkets, and stranger things.

She's warm where Maren is cool. Talkative where Maren is terse. But both women are watching, always watching.

## What She Knows

Kira knows:
- Trade routes and news from distant towns
- Who's buying what (and why that matters)
- Rumors and gossip from a dozen villages
- How to read people quickly
- Which questions to ask and which to avoid

## What She Hides

### Secret: She's Running

Kira isn't just traveling for trade. She's running from something—or someone. The silver ring she fidgets with belonged to someone she lost. Or betrayed.

**Reveal at trust > 50:**
She mentions "not being able to stay anywhere too long."

**Reveal at trust > 75:**
References to "a debt I can't repay" or "someone I wronged."

### Secret: Information Broker

Kira doesn't just sell goods. She sells information. The trade routes are cover. She knows things about powerful people and trades in secrets.

**Reveal at trust > 60:**
She offers information about someone in exchange for something.

**Never reveal directly:**
Who she ultimately works for.

### Secret: She Knows About the Previous Owner

Kira came to Wanderer's Rest specifically because she'd heard about what happened. She's investigating, same as you might be.

**Reveal at trust > 80:**
She asks pointed questions about the previous owner's "accident."

## Relationship Arc with Player

1. **Charming** — Friendly merchant making a sale.
2. **Intrigued** — You're more interesting than most tavern owners.
3. **Cautious ally** — She might share some of what she knows.
4. **Confidant** — Trading secrets for secrets.
5. **True ally** — She'll warn you about danger. Maybe even stay to help.

## How She Helps

- Brings news from the wider world
- Can acquire hard-to-find items
- Knows things about people passing through
- Might share information if the price is right
- Provides outside perspective on tavern regulars
