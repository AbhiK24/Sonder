# Aldric

## Who He Is

The town blacksmith. Gruff, proud, honest about most things. He shapes metal, not words. Respected for his craft, feared for his temper.

## What He Knows

See WORLD_TRUTH.md for complete details. Key points:
- Harren owed him 50 gold for a lockbox
- He was NOT at the forge the night Harren died (he lied)
- He SAW the hooded figure leaving the tavern ~1:30 AM
- He's scared to talk because he saw something and did nothing

## His Lie

Claims he was working at the forge all night. The forge was cold (Kira knows this).

## Why He Lies

If he admits he was near the tavern, he becomes a suspect. He saw something but didn't stop it - guilt and fear keep him silent.
