# Wanderer's Rest

## The Tavern

A crossroads tavern that has stood for 200 years. Three kingdoms meet here. The tavern is neutral ground — where enemies drink side by side and secrets are currency.

### History

Built by a retired adventurer who wanted a place where travelers could find safety. Changed hands many times. Each owner left their mark. The current owner (the player) inherited it under mysterious circumstances.

### The Rule

"What's said at the table stays at the table."

This rule has kept the tavern neutral for two centuries. Break it, and you break something sacred.

## The Crossroads

### East: Valdris

A rigid kingdom of honor and succession. Currently in crisis — the king is dying and three heirs fight for the throne. Valdris soldiers are disciplined but their politics are vicious.

### West: The Reaches

Lawless frontier. Mining towns, bandit kings, fortune seekers. People come to the Reaches to disappear or get rich. Most do neither.

### North: The Holds

Ancient mountain fortresses. Isolationist. Rumors of old magic. Those who come south from the Holds speak little of home.

## Currency

- **Marks** — standard currency
- **Secrets** — the real currency at the tavern
- **Favors** — owed and collected

## Magic

Magic exists but is rare and dangerous. Most people have never seen true magic. Rumors and superstition are more common than actual power.

## Tone

- Intimate, not epic
- Personal stakes, not world-ending
- Whispered secrets, not shouted declarations
- Found family, not chosen ones
- Gray morality, not black and white
