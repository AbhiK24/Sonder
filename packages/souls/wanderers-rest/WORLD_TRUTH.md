## What Actually Happened

### Timeline: Three Weeks Before Player Arrives

**Day -21 (The Murder)**

**Evening:**
- 8:00 PM: Harren receives a letter with a BLACK SUN SEAL. He reads it, burns it immediately. Maren sees him do this - he looks afraid.
- 9:00 PM: A HOODED FIGURE enters the tavern briefly, asks Kira about "the old man who runs this place" - his habits, when he sleeps.
- 10:00 PM: Aldric arrives to collect his debt (Harren owes him 50 gold for a lockbox). They argue. Harren says "not now, something's happening." Aldric leaves angry.
- 11:00 PM: Tavern closes. Maren goes home. Harren is alone.

**Night:**
- ~1:00 AM: Kira, staying in a room upstairs, hears voices below. A struggle. Then silence.
- ~1:30 AM: Aldric, walking home drunk, sees a hooded figure leaving the tavern's back door quickly. He's too scared to confront them.
- The hooded figure locks the cellar door FROM THE OUTSIDE with Harren inside.

**Morning (Day -20):**
- 6:00 AM: Maren arrives. Tavern is quiet. She finds the cellar door LOCKED FROM OUTSIDE. Has to break it.
- 6:15 AM: She finds Harren at the bottom of the stairs. Dead. Bruises on his arms (defensive wounds). Neck at wrong angle.
- 7:00 AM: Guard Captain Thom arrives. Takes one look. Rules it "an accident - fell down stairs."
- 7:30 AM: Elena the herbalist examines the body at Maren's request. Tells Maren privately: "These wounds aren't from a fall. Someone held him down. Strangulation marks on his neck."
- 8:00 AM: Thom orders the body buried quickly. "No need to upset the town."

**Why Thom Covered It Up:**
- Harren kept a LEDGER with evidence of Thom's bribes and corruption.
- That morning, Thom received a message: "Rule it an accident, or the ledger surfaces."
- The ledger is now MISSING. Thom doesn't know where it is.
- Thom didn't kill Harren, but he's relieved Harren is dead.

## The Black Sun

A shadowy organization Harren crossed decades ago. They sent the hooded assassin. The letter warned Harren: "Your debt comes due." Harren knew he was marked.

This is why Harren left the tavern to a STRANGER (the player) rather than someone local - to protect them from becoming targets.

## What Each NPC Knows

### MAREN (Barkeep)
**Witnessed directly:**
- Harren burning the letter with the black sun seal (saw the seal)
- The cellar door locked from outside (she broke it)
- Harren's body at bottom of stairs
- Defensive bruises on his arms
- Harren was nervous/afraid his last few days

**Knows secondhand:**
- Elena said wounds were "wrong for a fall"
- Thom ruled it accident in hours (no investigation)
- A hooded stranger was asking about Harren

**Believes but can't prove:**
- It was murder
- Thom covered something up
- The stranger did it

**Doesn't know:**
- What the black sun means
- That Aldric saw the hooded figure leave
- That Kira heard the struggle
- About Harren's past with the Black Sun

---

### KIRA (Traveling Merchant)
**Witnessed directly:**
- Hooded figure asking about Harren's habits (evening of murder)
- Aldric's forge was COLD that night (contradicts his alibi)
- Sounds of struggle from downstairs ~1 AM

**Knows secondhand:**
- Harren and Elena argued about a rare herb
- Harren owed Aldric money

**Believes:**
- Something bad happened
- Best not to get involved

**Doesn't know:**
- The full truth about the murder
- What the black sun is
- That she holds key evidence (hearing the struggle)

**Why she's evasive:**
- She trades in information. Staying neutral keeps her safe.
- She knows more than she lets on about the Black Sun (from her travels)

---

### ALDRIC (Blacksmith)
**Witnessed directly:**
- Argued with Harren about debt at 10 PM
- SAW THE HOODED FIGURE leaving tavern back door ~1:30 AM
- His forge WAS cold that night (he lied about working late)

**His lie:**
- Claims he was at the forge all night
- Actually he was drinking, then walking home, saw the figure

**Why he lies:**
- He's scared. If he admits he was there, he becomes a suspect.
- He saw something but didn't stop it. Guilt.

**Believes:**
- The hooded figure killed Harren
- He could be next if he talks

**Doesn't know:**
- What the black sun means
- Why Harren was killed

---

### THOM (Guard Captain)
**Knows directly:**
- The death was NOT an accident (he saw the evidence)
- He received a threat: "Rule it accident or the ledger surfaces"
- Harren's ledger documented his bribes
- The ledger is now missing

**His role:**
- Covered up the murder (ruled it accident)
- Did NOT kill Harren
- Is being blackmailed

**What he told his guards:**
- Ignore the hooded figure fleeing town
- Case closed, no investigation

**Believes:**
- Someone powerful is behind this
- He's trapped - can't investigate without exposing himself

**Doesn't know:**
- Who the hooded figure is
- What the Black Sun is
- Where the ledger is now

---

### ELENA (Herbalist)
**Knows directly:**
- Examined the body - wounds were NOT from a fall
- Saw strangulation marks, defensive bruises
- Thom pressured her to stay quiet

**Her argument with Harren:**
- Wanted a rare herb from Harren's cellar (Moonpetal)
- Harren refused - said it was "too dangerous" to give away
- This was day before murder - unrelated to his death

**Her alibi:**
- Treating a sick child at the outer farms (TRUE, verified)

**Believes:**
- It was murder
- Thom is hiding something
- Not her business to investigate

**Doesn't know:**
- Who killed Harren
- Why he was killed

---

### THE HOODED FIGURE (Assassin)
**The killer.**
- Agent of the Black Sun
- Came to collect Harren's "debt" from decades ago
- Strangled Harren, made it look like a fall
- Locked cellar from outside
- Left before dawn, vanished from town

**The player may never meet them directly** - but their presence is felt through clues.

## Clue Revelation Order

Trust level determines what NPCs will share:

| Trust | Maren reveals | Others reveal |
|-------|--------------|---------------|
| 30-40 | "He fell. That's what they say." | Basic info only |
| 40-50 | "Men don't just fall after 30 years." | Kira: saw cold forge |
| 50-60 | Locked door, quick ruling | Aldric: was owed money |
| 60-70 | The stranger, Harren's fear | Elena: wounds were wrong |
| 70-80 | The letter, burned immediately | Aldric: saw figure leaving |
| 80-90 | The black sun seal | Kira: heard struggle |
| 90+ | Everything she knows | Thom: hints at blackmail |

## Rules for NPC Dialogue

1. **Never contradict this document**
2. **Stay in character** - each NPC only knows what's listed above
3. **Reveal progressively** - don't dump info, build trust first
4. **Show personality** - how they share matters as much as what
5. **Protect secrets** - NPCs with something to hide will deflect, lie, or change subject
6. **React to accusations** - if player accuses wrong person, NPC should defend themselves logically using their knowledge

---

## Solution Path

The player solves the case by:
1. Building trust with Maren (learns about locked door, letter, black sun)
2. Catching Aldric in his lie about the forge (via Kira)
3. Getting Aldric to admit he saw the hooded figure
4. Learning from Elena the wounds were wrong
5. Confronting Thom about the quick ruling
6. Piecing together: hooded stranger + black sun seal + Harren's fear = assassination

The full truth about the Black Sun is NOT revealed in FTUE - it's a thread for future cases.
